>**Machine Language**

A computer’s CPU is incapable of speaking C++. The limited set of instructions that a CPU can understand directly is called machine code (or machine language or an instruction set). Example: 10110000 01100001


>**Assembly Language**

Because machine language is so hard for humans to read and understand, assembly language was invented. In an assembly language, each instruction is identified by a short abbreviation (rather than a set of bits), and names and other numbers can be used.


>**High-level Languages**

To address the readability and portability concerns, new programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal (and later, languages such as Java, Javascript, and Perl) were developed. These languages are called high level languages, as they are designed to allow the programmer to write programs without having to be as concerned about what kind of computer the program will be run on.


**Compiler** is a program (or collection of programs) that reads source code (typically written in a high-level language) and translates it into some other language (typically a low-level language, such as assembly or machine language, etc…).

**Interpreter** is a program that directly executes the instructions in the source code without requiring them to be compiled into an executable first.

>*Q: What is C++ good at?*
C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed
- Embedded SW
- Real-time systems
- High-performance financial applications
- Graphical applications / simulations
- AI and Neural networks
